***The theme is switched to "Several Strange Things about JM"!***  

JM是某个人的大大的玩具。因为下面这些奇葩的事情，都只会发生在过家家的游戏中，而不会出现在常规的生意中。  
JM is someone's big toy. Because the following weird things will only happen in house-playing games, not in regular business.

## 1. 没有高级管理团队，只有董事长和部门经理；  
一个董事长，下面将近20个部门都要向他汇报工作，请问这样的公司治理机制有可能获得一个很高效率的工作结果吗？

## 2. 被离职的人会被拉回来继续工作；  
这一点的确让人目瞪口呆。在JM，一个人即使被辞退，你也要做好哪一天他还会回来和你做同事的心理准备。

## 3. 拥有庞大的硬件团队，来完成持续不断的硬件降本；  
这个团队是董事长的。过去的十几年里，他们从一个方案商成长到将近50人的规模，再加上将近50人的嵌入式软件团队，规模已经很大了。如果每天的工作变成了重复的降本，那么价值就变得有限了。

## 4. 裁员不给补偿金；  
已经有很多人成功通过劳动仲裁拿到了赔偿金，包括N+1个月的薪资，以及少缴偷缴的社保公积金。JM公司看起来强大，但是你一申请劳动仲裁，他就立刻变软说能不能调解。之前很多员工本着多一事不如少一事的原则，常常选择同意调解。但是，也有一部分员工，开始坚定的拒绝调解，让法院开庭审理。最终这些败诉记录都会成为JM的污点。并且，大家记住，在深圳，只要你赢了诉讼，那么连 **5000元的律师费**都是由JM来承担的。如果你需要这样的律师，请联系本文开头的邮箱。  
**记住**，当你离职的时候，不需要签署任何文件，那些文件会让你失去某些补偿的机会，比如说一直都没有给你缴足的社保金和住房公积金。  
**记住**，当HR找你谈话的时候，请记得录音，这是你保证自己权益的重要手段。  
**记住**，他们口头答应的任何东西，都是有可能会反悔的。一定要拿到书面赔偿文件后再开始工作交接，以确保你自身的权利。

## 5. 400多人却没有几个硕士工程师，没有关键技术的投入；  
这么些年，JM一直不太愿意在核心算法等方面进行技术投资。所以，在基于gsensor的急加速、急减速、急转弯、碰撞检测等方面，产品性能表现一般。在DVR产品领域，也几乎没有任何核心技术的投入。  
这在中国的科技公司里非常罕见。JM公司的研发人员，还有一部分专科生。所以，JM看起来不太像一个科技公司，而是一个贸易公司，JM只是在GPS和通信芯片方面的基础上，进行了集成开发。  
这和这个公司实际控制人Gao的学识学历、战略眼光、长远谋划的能力有极大的关系。他是学硬件开发的，又不能授权给其它高级管理者来决策和实施长远的技术战略。

## 最奇葩的是，JM倔强的活到了现在  
俗话说得好，一头猪站在风口上，也能飞起来。JM之前运气不错，有了一点资本、技术和人才的积累。  
虽然几度IPO搁浅，虽然几度危机重重，JM之前有贵人相助，有了一次次翻身的奇迹。  
但是，人散了，气运也会转折；势变了，奇迹终将离去。

## 1. There is no senior management team, only the chairman and department managers;  
For a chairman, nearly 20 departments under him have to report to him. Is it possible for such a corporate governance mechanism to achieve a highly efficient work result?

## 2. Those who have been resigned will be pulled back to continue working;  
This is indeed jaw-dropping. In JM, even if a person is fired, you have to be mentally prepared that one day he will come back and be your colleague.

## 3. Have a huge hardware team to complete continuous hardware cost down;  
This team is owned by the chairman. In the past ten years, they have grown from a solution provider to a scale of nearly 50 people, plus an embedded software team of nearly 50 people, the scale is already very large. If daily work becomes repetitive cost reduction, then the value becomes limited.

## 4. No compensation for layoffs;  
Many people have successfully obtained compensation through labor arbitration, including N+1 months' salary, and underpaid social security provident funds. JM Company seems powerful, but as soon as you apply for labor arbitration, he immediately softens and asks whether mediation is possible. In the past, many employees often chose to agree to mediation based on the principle that more things are worse than less things. However, some employees began to firmly refuse mediation and let the court hold a trial. In the end, these losing records will become a stain on JM. And, remember, in Shenzhen, as long as you win the lawsuit, even the 5,000 legal fees will be borne by JM. If you need such a lawyer, please contact the mailbox at the beginning of this article.  
Remember, when you leave your job, you don't need to sign any documents. Those documents will make you lose some opportunities for compensation, such as the social security fund and housing provident fund that have not been paid to you in full. Remember, when HR talks to you, please remember to record it. This is an important means for you to protect your rights. Remember, anything they say they promise, they may back away from it. Be sure to get a written compensation document before starting the work handover to ensure your own rights.

## 5. There are more than 400 people, but there are few master degree engineers, and there is no investment in key technology;  
Over the years, JM has been reluctant to invest in technology such as core algorithms. Therefore, in terms of rapid acceleration, rapid deceleration, sharp turn, collision detection, etc. based on gsensor, the performance of the product is not good. In the field of DVR products, there is almost no investment in any core technology.  
It is very rare in Chinese technology companies. R & D personnel of JM Company, and some junior college students. Therefore, JM does not look like a technology company, but a trading company. JM only conducts integrated development on the basis of GPS and communication chips.  
This has a lot to do with the company's actual controller, Gao,'s academic qualifications, strategic vision, and long-term planning capabilities. He learned hardware development, but he could not authorize other executives to make decisions and implement long-term technology strategies.  

## The most amazing thing is that JM stubbornly survived till now  
As the saying goes, a pig can fly if it stands on the wind. JM was lucky before, with a little accumulation of capital, technology and talents.  
Although the IPO was stranded several times, although there were many crises several times, JM had the help of noble people before, and there were miracles of turning over again and again.  
However, if the people are scattered, the fortune will also turn around; if the situation changes, the miracle will eventually leave.
