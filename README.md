***********Chapter 1***********

GXX and RW have one company called JM.
One day, they had a conflict. GXX stigmatized RW for having mental problems and kicked her out of the company.
If RW really had a problem, how could she lead the team to work hard, ultimately allowing JM to achieve significant business performance growth in 2022 and become the best financial year in JM's history.
Due to the conflict between the GXX and RW , many employees of JM Company are in various difficult situations, and suppliers are slowly losing trust in JM, making the company's operation difficult. How wayward.
Because GXX believes that many people have good relationships with RW, helping her gain control of the company. GXX actively dismissed these people, but was unwilling to provide severance compensation, and even maliciously slandered them. How childish, how despicable. These people include executive vice presidents, chief financial officers, general managers of software platforms. Because of the passive resignation of these people, many employees left JM voluntarily.
After they left JM, they thought that GXX's approach was very wrong, but he didn't know it. So, together with them, RW decided to set up a new company and take the initiative to participate in the business competition with JM. In the end, it forced JM's financial situation to deteriorate sharply, and it began to lay off employees to maintain JM's survival by reducing costs.

GXX和RW有一家名为JM的公司。
有一天，他们发生了冲突。GXX找到理由说RW有精神问题，并将她赶出了公司。
如果RW真的有问题，她怎么能带领团队努力工作，最终让JM在2022年实现显著的业务业绩增长，成为JM历史上最好的财政年度。

由于GXX和RW之间的冲突，JM公司的许多员工处于各种困难的境地，供应商对JM逐渐失去信任，使公司的运营变得困难。多么任性。
因为GXX认为很多人都和RW关系很好，帮助她控制了公司。GXX主动解雇这些人，却不愿提供遣散费，甚至恶意诽谤他们。多么幼稚，多么卑鄙。这些人包括常务副总裁、财务总监、软件平台总经理。因为这些人的被动离职，还有很多员工因此主动离开了JM。

他们离开JM后，认为GXX的做法非常错误，但是他却不自知。所以，RW和他们一起，决定成立一家新的公司，主动参与和JM的商业竞争。最终迫使JM的财务状况急剧恶化，开始裁员，通过缩减成本，来维持JM的生存。

***********Chapter 2***********

Many people left JM to initiate labor arbitration and did not accept mediation. What a sad thing this is.
A small number of people left JM and received compensation. However, the evaluation of JM is very negative. How cute.
Why is this the case for JM's HR? Because the boss wants to do this. Because of a job. Because of this income. Because there is nothing to do. Because the bottom line in their heart is so low.

许多人离开JM发起劳动仲裁，不接受调解。这是一件多么可悲的事情。
少数人离开JM并获得了赔偿。然而，JM的评价是非常负面的。多么可爱。

JM的HR为什么会这样呢？因为老板要这么干。因为一份工作。因为这一份收入。因为无可奈何。因为心里的底线就是这么低。

JM HR现在已经是工贼了吗？[https://www.zhihu.com/question/358274446]
Is JM HR now a scab?
1、从阶级属性上看，HR就是打工人，应该是工人阶级的一分子，HR不应该是“工贼”。
2、从微观上看，的确有HR“助纣为虐”的情况，究其原因无非是:
(1)狐假虎威，自认为自己是老板利益的代表，事实上无非是“乌克兰”式的旗子。
(2)被逼无奈，老板要做好人，那坏人谁做?
业务部门做?no，no，no人家忙着做业绩呢!
领导去做?no，no，no领导也不想做坏人啊!再说了这等俗事儿，怎么可以让十指不沾阳春水的领导去做呢?
最后，只有HR最适合做这事儿!因为HR-就是做人的工作的!
这事儿交给你，没毛病!
3、HR不知道自己是“助纣为虐”吗?
(1)小部分HR，生活在自己的迷幻中，不可自拔，不知道，甚至还为自己的“大义凛然”沾沾自喜。
(2)绝大部分HR是知道的，但是既然干了这个岗位，不得不做一些事情，内心也有不可名状的痛苦。
1. From the perspective of class attributes, HR is a worker and should be a member of the working class, and HR should not be a "scab".
2. From a microscopic point of view, there is indeed a situation of HR "aiding and abusing", and the reason is nothing more than that:
(1) The fox fake tiger power, who considers himself the representative of the interests of the boss, is in fact nothing more than a "Ukrainian" flag.
(2) Forced helpless, the boss wants to be a good person, who does the bad guy?
What does the business unit do? No, no, no people are busy doing performance!
Leaders to do it? No, no, no leaders don't want to be bad guys! Besides, after talking about such mundane things, how can the leader who does not stick to the sun and spring water do it?
In the end, only HR is best suited to do this! Because HR - is to do people's work!
Leave this to you, no problem!
3. Does HR not know that he is "aiding and abusing"?
(1) A small part of HR, living in their own psychedelia, cannot extricate themselves, do not know, and even complacent about their "great righteousness".
(2) Most HR knows, but since they have done this position, they have to do something, and they also have unspeakable pain in their hearts.

***********Chapter 3***********

JM硬件人的自我评价：经验丰富，规模庞大，但是技术陈旧，效率低下。我就喜欢不断的改芯片，这样显得我工作量饱满啊。我就要找专人来焊电路板，我是做设计的，凭让我来干这种脏活累活。我们50个硬件人，代表JM的历史沉淀和希望，我们跟着高老板这么多年，你能怎么的，就是牛啊，没有我们，哪有JM的今天。

Self-evaluation of JM hardware people: experienced, large-scale, but outdated technology and inefficiency. I like to keep changing chips, so I look like I'm full of work. I'm going to find someone to solder the circuit board, and I'm doing the design, so I'm going to do this dirty work. We 50 hardware people, representing the historical precipitation and hope of several meters, we have followed the high boss for so many years, how can you, is a cow, without us, how can there be several meters today.

JM嵌入式软件人的自我评价：重复劳动，修修补补，缺乏创新，我们努力做好惠州嵌入式软件的人才培养基地。NND，这么多的定制产品需要开发，大部分就是换了某个芯片，目的就是为了降低成本，对我来讲都是重复劳动啊。平均每人每年都要完成十几个版本的开发、更新和维护，很累，但是软件代码的质量有时候难以保证。

Self-evaluation of JM embedded software people: repeated labor, tinkering, lack of innovation, we strive to do a good job in Huizhou embedded software talent training base. NND, so many customized products need to be developed, most of them are replaced with a certain chip, the purpose is to reduce costs, for me it is repetitive work. On average, each person has to complete the development, update and maintenance of more than a dozen versions every year, which is very tiring, but the quality of software code is sometimes difficult to guarantee.

JM平台软件人的自我评价：背负沉重的历史包袱，负重前行，人才流失严重。真的没法干啊，每年都在换领导，每个领导思路都不一样。 所以只能执行短期的计划，所有长远的规划都没办法落地。高手都走了啊，那就让我再多混一段时间吧。 有些项目源代码都丢了，你说我能怎么办？ N年前的系统我要维护，新的项目又要开发，又有那么多大家都不敢碰的垃圾的历史的代码，太难了。

Self-evaluation of JM platform software people: carrying heavy historical baggage, carrying a heavy burden forward, and serious brain drain. I really can't do it, I change leaders every year, and each leadership idea is different. Therefore, only short-term plans can be implemented, and all long-term plans cannot be implemented. The masters are gone, so let me fool around for a while. Some project source code is lost, what do you say I can do? The system N years ago I had to maintain, new projects to develop, and so many garbage history codes that no one dared to touch, it was too difficult.

JM硬件产品人的自我评价：90%的精力都在处理细枝末节的客诉和调整，几乎没有时间来处理长远的规划和需求。改个器件立个项，几个月过去了，工资到手，挺好的。一周一个SKU，根本不是事儿。可惜这个公司不愿意好好做算法和技术沉淀，奉行拿来主义，很难保持持续的产品一致性。

Self-evaluation of JM hardware product people: 90% of the energy is spent on dealing with minutiae customer complaints and adjustments, and there is almost no time to deal with long-term planning and needs. Change the device to set up a project, a few months have passed, the salary is in hand, very good. One SKU a week is not a thing at all. Unfortunately, this company is unwilling to do a good job of algorithm and technology precipitation, pursues take-it-it-allism, and it is difficult to maintain continuous product consistency.

JM销售的自我评价：产品看上去是挺多的，但是真正能卖的就那么几个。研发看上去人是挺多的，那为什么每个产品开发都要大半年？为什么有些客户需求一年过去了，还没有上线？为什么呀为什么？好在这个公司里混水摸鱼还算比较容易，有单没单的我多等等，总会有客户上钩的吧。我们奉行的宗旨就是“姜太公钓鱼，愿者上钩”。

Self-evaluation of JM sales: There seem to be a lot of products, but there are only a few that can really be sold. R&D seems to be quite a lot of people, so why does it take half a year for each product development? Why are some customer needs still not online after a year? Why, why? Fortunately, it is relatively easy to fish in this company, there are many singles and so on, there will always be customers who take the bait. The tenet we pursue is "JiangTaiGong fishes, those who wish to take the bait".

JM供应链的自我评价：各个领导带进来的的供应商还是太多了，各种莫名其妙的原因更换供应商。有些明显的利益输送，也没办法。连硬件开发都要插手供应商的变更，真是闻所未闻。每年好几个亿的采购额，采购的漏洞太大。但是，我们还是被无限压缩的交付周期搞得焦头烂额。各种无脑的采购命令使得永远有各种呆滞料需要处理。库存太高了，那帮销售吃啥的，卖不出去还要疯狂备货。

Self-evaluation of JM supply chain: There are still too many suppliers brought in by various leaders, and various inexplicable reasons change suppliers. There are some obvious benefits transferred, and there is no way. Even hardware development has to intervene in supplier changes, which is really unheard of. With hundreds of millions of dollars in procurement every year, the loopholes in procurement are too big. However, we were still overwhelmed by infinitely compressed lead times. Various brainless purchasing orders make there always all kinds of sluggish material to deal with. The inventory is too high, what the sales eat, can't sell and have to be frantically stocked.

***********Chapter 4***********

JM的产品出货量在持续下滑。最近几个月里，每个月的出货量只有30多万台，下降了30%。所以，JM公司的现金流枯竭的风险正在显著上升。所以才有了上面各种裁员的骚操作。
并且，JM的库存产品和原材料占用的资金在快速增长。

JM's product shipments continue to decline. In recent months, shipments have been just over 300,000 units per month, down 30 percent. As a result, the risk of JM's cash flow drying up is rising significantly. That's why there are all kinds of layoffs above.
Moreover, the funds occupied by JM's inventory products and raw materials are growing rapidly.

***********Chapter 5***********

JM奇葩的地方：把曾经被开除的离职员工叫回来，因为是rw开除的，我就是要叫回来，气死你，就是这么幼稚，你能怎么滴。被叫回来的，大部分还是高管，让人惊的一批，这是什么骚操作。只好在高管离职的时候送上一句话，后会有期。可能这就是JM的“念旧”文化。有的高管戏称，刚拿了N+1的补偿走人，很快又把我叫回来，这样给我发钱我会不好意思的，这样难道不涉及偷税漏税吗？

A few meters of strange place: call back the departing employee who was once fired, because it was fired by RW, I just want to call it back, you off, it's so childish, how can you drop. Most of the people who were called back were still executives, a shocking batch, what kind of commotion is this. I had to send a sentence when the executive left, and there would be a period later. Perhaps this is JM's "nostalgia" culture. Some high level manager jokingly said that they just took N+1 compensation and left, and soon called me back, so I will be embarrassed to send me money, so doesn't this involve tax evasion?

***********Chapter 6***********

大家认为DW才是最想成为JM接班人的那个人。毕竟GXX的年纪越来越大，总有一天会放手生意上的事情。那么所有JM的高管都可能成为DW潜在的竞争对手。这就造成JM很奇葩的一个现象，这么大的一个公司，居然没有高管团队。JM只有一个总裁和N个部门经理。这些年来来回回这么多的高管，都走了，只有DW成为了唯一的JM最年轻和最长工作时间的高管人员。
你可能不知道DW的风流韵事吧。那个Zhou，曾经就因DW而怀孕了，无奈，只好离开了JM。

Everyone thinks DW is the one who wants to be JM's successor the most. After all, GXX is getting older and will one day let go of business matters. Then all JM executives could become potential competitors to DW. This has led to a very strange phenomenon in JM, such a large company, there is no executive team. JM has only one president and N department managers. With so many executives going back and forth over the years, all gone, only DW became the only JM youngest and longest-working executive.
You probably don't know DW's affair. That Zhou, who was once pregnant due to DW, had no choice but to leave JM.

***********Chapter 7***********

LWY是JM供应链的负责人。曾经就是一个普通的员工，在RW的支持和培养下，快速成长成为了JM的一级部门的负责人。当RW决定成立新公司的时候，LWY信誓当当的说她一定全力支持RW。可以需要她离开JM到新公司工作的时候，LWY却背叛了RW，并且出卖了RW他们一伙人的很多信息，让RW他们的新公司遇到了一点点的小问题。所以，看一个人，要看关键时候她是不是能够挺身而出，而不是看她用嘴巴说了什么。

LWY is the head of JM Supply Chain. He used to be an ordinary employee, but with the support and training of RW, he quickly grew up and became the head of the first-level department of JM. When RW decided to set up a new company, LWY swore that she would fully support RW. When it was necessary for her to leave JM to work in a new company, LWY betrayed RW and betrayed a lot of information about RW and their group, which caused RW and their new company to encounter a little problem. Therefore, looking at a person depends on whether she can stand up at the critical moment, not what she says with her mouth.

***********Chapter 8***********

已经有很多人成功通过劳动仲裁拿到了赔偿金，包括N+1个月的薪资，以及少缴偷缴的社保公积金。JM公司看起来强大，但是你一申请劳动仲裁，他就立刻变软说能不能调解。之前很多员工本着多一事不如少一事的原则，常常选择同意调解。但是，也有一部分员工，开始坚定的拒绝调解，让法院开庭审理。最终这些败诉记录都会成为JM的污点。并且，大家记住，在深圳，只要你赢了诉讼，那么连5000的律师费都是由JM来承担的。如果你需要这样的律师，请联系本文开头的邮箱。

Many people have successfully obtained compensation through labor arbitration, including N+1 months' salary, and underpaid social security provident funds. JM Company seems powerful, but as soon as you apply for labor arbitration, he immediately softens and asks whether mediation is possible. In the past, many employees often chose to agree to mediation based on the principle that more things are worse than less things. However, some employees began to firmly refuse mediation and let the court hold a trial. In the end, these losing records will become a stain on JM. And, remember, in Shenzhen, as long as you win the lawsuit, even the 5,000 legal fees will be borne by JM. If you need such a lawyer, please contact the mailbox at the beginning of this article.
